helm:
  # Use a custom location for the Helm chart. This can refer to any go-getter URL or
  # OCI registry based helm chart URL e.g. "oci://ghcr.io/fleetrepoci/guestbook".
  # This allows one to download charts from most any location.  Also know that
  # go-getter URL supports adding a digest to validate the download. If repo
  # is set below this field is the name of the chart to lookup
  chart: kafka-ui
  # A https URL to a Helm repo to download the chart from. It's typically easier
  # to just use `chart` field and refer to a tgz file.  If repo is used the
  # value of `chart` will be used as the chart name to lookup in the Helm repository.

  # Makes helm skip the check for its own annotations
  takeOwnership: false
  # The version of the chart or semver constraint of the chart to find. If a constraint
  # is specified it is evaluated each time git changes.
  # The version also determines which chart to download from OCI registries.
